"Brawl Staking"
- Users will be able to stake their NFTs to allow fights (and accrue rewards)
- A staked NFT can attack or be attacked at any time

"Brawl Coin"
- Emits coins (rewards) for users that "stake" an NFT and win matches;
- Allows burning of the coins to spend on a marketplace tied to the game
